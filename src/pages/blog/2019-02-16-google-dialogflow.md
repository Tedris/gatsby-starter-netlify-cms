So I'm working on a chatbot at work.  It's a neat experience but takes a lot of work to set up different conversations.  Right now I have a basic bot setup for the site but it's just embedded code, I need to write a custom bot that works better with the CSS rather than using the basic embedded iframe that DialogFlow gives me.

I'm considering putting all of my experience style questions in the bot, but will consider just making a regular page for info in case the bot is down too.
